SEM detectors will be used in the high dose rate environments of LHC because of their low sensitivity and excellent linearity. The design of SEM consists of two bias electrodes separating the produced secondary electrons from the Ti signal electrode placed in a vacuum steel cylinder. The response of the chamber was tested with bunched and continuous proton beams and compared with a reference detector and GEANT4 simulations."

The physics processes offered cover a comprehensive range, including electromagnetic, hadronic and optical processes, a large set of long-lived particles, materials and elements, over a wide energy range starting, in some cases, from 250eV and extending in others to the TeV energy range. It has been designed and constructed to expose the physics models utilised, to handle complex geometries, and to enable its easy adaptation for optimal use in different sets of applications. The toolkit is the result of a worldwide collaboration of physicists and software engineers. It has been created exploiting software engineering and object-oriented technology and implemented in the C++ programming language. It has been used in applications in particle physics, nuclear physics, accelerator design, space engineering and medical physics.}

It is used by a large number of experiments and projects in a variety of application domains, including high energy physics, astrophysics and space science, medical physics and radiation protection. Over the past several years, major changes have been made to the toolkit in order to accommodate the needs of these user communities, and to efficiently exploit the growth of computing power made available by advances in technology. The adaptation of Geant4 to multithreading, advances in physics, detector modeling and visualization, extensions to the toolkit, including biasing and reverse Monte Carlo, and tools for physics and release validation are discussed here.}

abstract = {To devise an activation technique for characterizing mixed radiation fields, secondary particles from a copper target irradiated by 24 GeV/c protons were measured at the CERN High-energy AcceleRator Mixed field facility (CHARM). Activation detector sets consisting of aluminum, niobium, indium, and bismuth, were placed at 30 cm from the target at angles of 15° to 160° with respect to the beam axis. The nuclides generated in these detectors due to irradiation by secondary particles were analyzed by γ-ray spectrometry, and the angular distributions of the production rates were obtained. The results of Monte Carlo calculations using FLUKA code was compared with the experimental results. The calculated results well agreed with the measured data at all angles. The influence of competitive reactions on the measured data were also evaluated by FLUKA. The following nuclear reactions, with low affectivity by competitive reactions, were identified as promising tools for characterizing mixed radiation fields: the 115In(n, n′)115mIn reaction for detecting neutrons emitted by the evaporation process, the 93Nb(γ, n)92mNb reaction for verifying the photon distribution generated by neutral-pion decay (π0→2γ), and the 209Bi(p, 4n)206Po reaction, which detects secondary protons.}

abstract = {The CERN High-Energy AcceleRator Mixed field (CHARM) facility provides a secondary particle field, produced by irradiating a thick target with 24 GeV/c protons supplied by the proton synchrotron. In order to investigate the thermalization process of secondary neutrons in the CHARM facility, we measured the thermal neutrons using the gold foil activation method. Bare and Cd-covered gold foils were placed at 35 positions to deduce the thermal neutron distribution in the CHARM facility. The 197Au(n, γ)198Au reaction rates and thermal neutron fluxes measured in this study were compared with the Monte Carlo simulation codes, PHITS, FLUKA, and MARS. The comparison between the measured and simulated values gives an agreement better than a factor of two. Besides, we investigated the simple empirical formula to estimate a thermal neutron flux in the accelerator room, ϕth = CQ/S, where Q is the neutron source intensity and S is the total surface area of a room. The coefficient C estimated in this study did not significantly depend on the incident proton beam energy.}

abstract = {The radiation field generated by a high energy and intensity accelerator is of concern in terms of element functionality threat, component damage, electronics reliability, and material activation, but also provides signatures that allow actual operating conditions to be monitored. The shower initiated by an energetic hadron involves many different physical processes, down to slow neutron interactions and fragment de-excitation, which need to be accurately described for design purposes and to interpret operation events. The experience with the transport and interaction Monte Carlo code FLUKA at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), operating at CERN with 4 TeV proton beams (and equivalent magnetic rigidity Pb beams) and approaching nominal luminosity and energy, is presented. Design, operation and upgrade challenges are reviewed in the context of beam-machine interaction account and relevant benchmarking examples based on radiation monitor measurements are shown.}
